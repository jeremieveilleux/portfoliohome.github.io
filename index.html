				<p>Hi! My name is J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Veilleux. I am currently in Grade 11 and attending Iroquois Ridge High School. This website has been created to be my Electronic Portfolio for the course of ICS3U1 or otherwise known as Computer Sciences taught by Ms Barsan. From the banner above, you can probably tell that on this website, you will find some Reflections, HTML & CSS pages, Algorithms, Turing, ISP's and finally Resources.

					<h4>Who am I?</h4>
					<div class="contentarea">
						<p>As mentioned before I go to Iroquois Ridge High School but I didn't always attend and English public school. Before starting High school I attended two diffrent French elementary schools called &Eacute;cole Sainte Marie and &Eacute;cole Sainte Famille. I was placed in these schools wanted me to learn French and not risk forgetting the language as I am born in to a French family that moved here, in the GTA(Greater Toronto Area), when I was only 3 months old.</p>
						<p>Nowadays, I am trying to receive a sport and academic scholarship to the United States, preferably in the North-East of the country, as it is my dream to play baseball at the highest level possible. Currently the highest level or me is the collegiate level in the United States. Ultimately, the final goal is the Major Leagues but that is highly unlikely so I am concentrating on my school work and my grades.</p>
